    "section": "",
    "text": "Missing value imputation is a critical process in data preprocessing, essential for handling incomplete datasets and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of statistical analyses and machine learning models. Missing data can occur for various reasons, such as data entry errors, sensor malfunctions, or non-responses in surveys. Properly addressing missing values is vital for maintaining the integrity of analyses and improving predictive model performance.\n\n\nSeveral techniques are employed for missing value imputation, each with its own strengths and appropriate use cases. Key methods include:\nSimple Imputation: Replacing missing values with a single statistic, such as the mean, median, or mode of the observed data. This method is straightforward but may introduce bias if the data is not missing completely at random (MCAR). Regression Imputation: Using regression models to predict and replace missing values based on other available variables. This approach can account for relationships between variables but may not fully capture the uncertainty associated with the imputation. Multiple Imputation: Creating several imputed datasets by replacing missing values with multiple plausible estimates, analyzing each dataset separately, and then combining the results. This method provides a robust estimate of the uncertainty due to missing data. Machine Learning Imputation: Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forests, or neural networks to predict and impute missing values. These methods can handle complex patterns in the data but require careful tuning and validation.\n\n\n\nIn biological and medical research, accurate missing value imputation is crucial for:\nGenomics: Imputing missing genotypic data to enable comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other genetic analyses. Clinical Trials: Ensuring the validity of trial results by appropriately handling missing patient data. Epidemiology: Accurately estimating disease prevalence and risk factors when faced with incomplete survey data."

    "text": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of small, naturally occurring molecules that play a crucial role in the innate immune response by targeting a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and even cancer cells. These peptides are found across all domains of life, from humans to plants and microorganisms, and are recognized for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and their potential as therapeutic agents.\n\n\nAMPs exert their antimicrobial effects through various mechanisms, primarily targeting microbial membranes but also affecting intracellular processes. Key mechanisms include:\nMembrane Disruption: AMPs can insert into microbial membranes, forming pores or disrupting membrane integrity, leading to cell lysis. Intracellular Targeting: Some AMPs can penetrate microbial cells and interfere with vital intracellular functions such as DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Immunomodulation: AMPs can modulate the host immune response by recruiting immune cells to infection sites and enhancing phagocytosis. Factors influencing AMP activity include:\nSequence and Structure: The amino acid composition, charge, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure (e.g., alpha-helices, beta-sheets) determine AMP activity and specificity. Environmental Conditions: Factors such as pH, ionic strength, and presence of serum proteins can affect AMP stability and activity.\n\n\n\nAMPs are integral to the defense mechanisms of organisms, providing a first line of defense against infections. They are involved in:\nDirect Antimicrobial Action: Killing or inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Immune System Modulation: Enhancing the immune response by promoting the activation and recruitment of immune cells. Wound Healing: Facilitating tissue repair and regeneration by promoting cell migration and angiogenesis.\n\n\n\nAMPs have significant potential in clinical applications due to their broad-spectrum activity and unique mechanisms of action. They are being explored for their therapeutic potential in:\nInfectious Diseases: As alternatives to traditional antibiotics, particularly in the face of rising antibiotic resistance. Cancer Therapy: Some AMPs have demonstrated anti-cancer properties by selectively targeting cancer cells. Inflammatory Diseases: AMPs can modulate inflammatory responses, offering potential treatments for conditions like sepsis and chronic inflammatory diseases."

My name is Katarzyna Sidorczuk and I’m a bioinformatician interested in gut microbiome and use of machine learning for analysis of biological data.\nDuring my PhD I worked with BioGenies and created multiple tools for prediction of peptide activity and protein localization. This led us to the work on negative data sampling for AMP prediction in which we showed that commonly used strategies introduce significance bias and leads to unreliable benchmarks.\nCurrently, I’m a postdoc in the Hildebrand group at the Quadram Institute, where I work with strain-resolved metagenomics.

The Narew National Park, known as the “Polish Amazon,” features unique river landscapes with meandering channels and abundant wildlife, perfect for canoeing and nature excursions.\n\n\n\nBiałystok hosts several festivals that celebrate its cultural diversity and vibrant arts scene. The Białystok Puppet Theater Festival attracts performers and audiences from around the world, showcasing the best in puppetry and theater. The Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic, one of the most modern cultural institutions in Poland, offers a range of concerts, operas, and ballet performances.\n\n\n\nVisitors to Białystok can savor the region’s unique culinary offerings, which blend Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Jewish influences.

From the very beginning, they made my integration seamless, even going the extra mile to set up a fully equipped kitchen, providing everything from casseroles to cutlery. Beyond that, they fostered a strong sense of fellowship by organizing regular team-building activities, such as trips and fun dinners together.\nWhat really stood out, though, was how outstanding this team is in the field of Bioinformatics. They are not only highly active in conducting cutting-edge research with multiple ongoing projects and publications, but they also offer exceptional mentorship. Whenever I had doubts, they were always there to guide me, providing valuable insights that helped me improve my skills and grow as a researcher. This experience has truly been enriching, both personally and professionally.\nBioGenies truly became my small Polish family during my time in Białystok.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRonja Tittel 🇩🇪\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRonja about her Leonardo/Erasmus+ praxissemester\n\n\n\nFrom the very first moment, I felt incredibly welcomed by the group—it was honestly amazing! Everyone was so kind and supportive, always ready to help with any research, answer my questions, or just be there whenever I needed something.\nThey organized so many fun activities to explore Białystok and the surrounding areas, making it really easy to get to know the city and meet new people. They also helped me with all the necessary paperwork, which was such a relief. Finding a place to stay was completely stress-free because they quickly helped me organize a flat in the student dorms. On top of that, they even provided kitchen necessities, so I didn’t have to buy anything for five months—such a thoughtful gesture!\nOne thing I truly appreciated was how much effort they put into helping me find a riding stable that suited me. Even though it turned out to be a bit difficult for me in the surrounding area, they still did everything they could to help, which meant a lot.\nThe work atmosphere here is just incredible. I always felt comfortable and knew I could trust everyone with any problem. It’s not just a group—it feels like a community where everyone looks out for each other. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Thank you for letting me stay with you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariia Solovianova 🇩🇪/🇺🇦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria about her Erasmus+ Mobility internship\n\n\n\nMy Erasmus stay in Białystok has been an incredible experience so far! The group welcomed me with open arms, and they are always eager to teach me new things and help me grow. Whenever I have any questions, they are quick to lend a hand and offer support. The social life here is fantastic, and it’s a great opportunity to experience the true spirit of Podlasie. We’ve had amazing integrative trips, such as to Białowieża, and we’re soon going to Suprasl. I’ve also had the chance to explore traditional Podlaskie cuisine, which has been a delightful experience. I’m really looking forward to the rest of my time here!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "🎉🥳 Big news alert! our very own Valen has just secured an NCN Miniatura grant for the project LIMAD: Large-scale identification of microorganism products impacting amyloid diseases! 🧬🦠💡\n\n\n🧠 Why this matters\nDiseases like Alzheimer’s 🧩, Parkinson’s 🎭 and ALS 🌀 are linked to clumps of harmful proteins called amyloids. These aggregates damage cells and are central to the progression of these conditions.\nBut here’s the twist: 🦠👀 microbes may be part of the story!. From gut bacteria to fungi in the brain, there’s growing evidence that microorganisms might help trigger or accelerate protein misfolding. That means the microbes around us (and inside us) could be influencing how these diseases develop.\n\n\n\n🔬 What LIMAD will do\nValen’s project will take on this challenge by:\n✨ Spotting microbes most linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s through careful review of scientific studies ✨ Checking their proteins with powerful computational tools to see if they have “myloid potential 💻⚡\n✨ Testing interactions with human proteins like Aβ42 and α-synuclein using cutting-edge ML and structural biology 🤖🔍\nTogether, this will give us clues about which microbes might secretly push amyloid diseases forward.\n\n\n\n🚀 What it means for the future\nIf LIMAD uncovers microbial proteins that drive amyloid formation, they could become new drug targets 💊✨. Imagine tackling neurodegenerative diseases not just through the brain, but by also looking at the microbiome 🌱🧫. That’s the big-picture vision!\n\n\n\n🎉 Huge congratulations, Valen! 🙌\nWe’re beyond proud to see you take on this ambitious project with NCN’s support 🇵🇱👏. It’s an amazing step forward for BioGenies 💚🧬 and for the fight against neurodegenerative diseases worldwide 🌍✨.\nStay tuned, we’ll be sharing updates from the LIMAD journey here! 📢🔥"

    "text": "Amyloids are highly structured, fibrous protein aggregates that are associated with a variety of physiological and pathological processes. These protein assemblies are characterized by their beta-sheet-rich structure, which allows them to form long, unbranched fibrils. Amyloid fibrils can accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to a range of diseases known as amyloidoses. However, not all amyloids are harmful; some play functional roles in normal cellular processes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a fundamental biophysical process that underlies the organization and compartmentalization within cells, without relying on membrane-bound structures. This phenomenon occurs when a homogenous solution of macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, spontaneously demixes into two coexisting liquid phases: a dense phase enriched in these macromolecules and a dilute phase that is relatively depleted of them. This phase separation is driven by weak, multivalent interactions among the molecules, including electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects, and specific binding domains.\n\n\nThe driving forces behind LLPS involve a delicate balance between attractive and repulsive interactions among macromolecules. Key factors influencing LLPS include:\nMultivalency: Proteins and nucleic acids with multiple interaction sites can engage in many weak interactions simultaneously, promoting phase separation. Intrinsic Disorder: Proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) often undergo LLPS due to their flexible, dynamic nature, which allows for transient interactions. Post-translational Modifications: Phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination can modulate protein-protein interactions, thereby influencing LLPS. Environmental Conditions: Changes in temperature, pH, ionic strength, and concentration of macromolecules can trigger or inhibit phase separation.\n\n\n\nLLPS is pivotal in forming various membrane-less organelles (MLOs) or biomolecular condensates that compartmentalize cellular components to enhance reaction kinetics, protect sensitive molecules, and regulate biological processes. Some key examples include:\nNucleoli: Sites of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and ribosome assembly within the nucleus. Stress Granules: Cytoplasmic aggregates that form in response to cellular stress, sequestering untranslated mRNAs and associated proteins. P-bodies: Cytoplasmic structures involved in mRNA decay and storage. Centrosomes: Organizing centers for microtubule nucleation during cell division.\n\n\n\nLLPS has profound implications for understanding cellular organization and disease mechanisms. Aberrant phase separation can lead to pathological aggregates associated with diseases such as:\nNeurodegenerative Diseases: Dysregulated phase separation can contribute to the formation of toxic protein aggregates in diseases like ALS, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. Cancer: Altered phase separation dynamics can affect signaling pathways and gene expression, contributing to tumorigenesis."
