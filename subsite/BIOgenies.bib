  abstract = {Protein aggregation has been associated with aging and different pathologies and represents a bottleneck in the industrial production of biotherapeutics. Numerous past studies performed in Escherichia coli and other model organisms have allowed to dissect the biophysical principles underlying this process. This knowledge fuelled the development of computational tools, such as Aggrescan 3D (A3D) to forecast and re-design protein aggregation. Here, we present the A3D Model Organism Database (A3D-MODB) http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D2/MODB, a comprehensive resource for the study of structural protein aggregation in the proteomes of 12 key model species spanning distant biological clades. In addition to A3D predictions, this resource incorporates information useful for contextualizing protein aggregation, including membrane protein topology and structural model confidence, as an indirect reporter of protein disorder. The database is openly accessible without any need for registration. We foresee A3D-MOBD evolving into a central hub for conducting comprehensive, multi-species analyses of protein aggregation, fostering the development of protein-based solutions for medical, biotechnological, agricultural~and industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Protein aggregation is behind the genesis of incurable diseases and imposes constraints on drug discovery and the industrial production and formulation of proteins. Over the years, we have been advancing the Aggresscan3D (A3D) method, aiming to deepen our comprehension of protein aggregation and assist the engineering of protein solubility. Since its inception, A3D has become one of the most popular structure-based aggregation predictors because of its performance, modular functionalities, RESTful service for extensive screenings, and intuitive user interface. Building on this foundation, we introduce Aggrescan4D (A4D), significantly extending A3D’s functionality. A4D is aimed at predicting the pH-dependent aggregation of protein structures, and features an evolutionary-informed automatic mutation protocol to engineer protein solubility without compromising structure and stability. It also integrates precalculated results for the nearly 500,000 jobs in the A3D Model Organisms Database and structure retrieval from the AlphaFold database. Globally, A4D constitutes a comprehensive tool for understanding, predicting, and designing solutions for specific protein aggregation challenges. The A4D web server and extensive documentation are available at https://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/a4d/. This website is free and open to all users without a login requirement.},

  abstract = {Pathogenic bacteria, such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), cause diarrhea in mammals. In particular, E. coli colonizes and infects the gastrointestinal tract via type 1 fimbriae (T1F). Here, the major zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2) acts as a host cell receptor. GP2 is also secreted by the pancreas and various mucous glands, interacting with luminal type 1 fimbriae-positive E. coli. It is unknown whether GP2 isoforms demonstrate specific E. coli pathotype binding. In this study, we investigated interactions of human, porcine, and bovine EPEC and ETEC, as well as commensal E. coli isolates with human, porcine, and bovine GP2. We first defined pathotype- and host-associated FimH variants. Second, we could prove that GP2 isoforms bound to FimH variants to various degrees. However, the GP2-FimH interactions did not seem to be influenced by the host specificity of E. coli. In contrast, soluble GP2 affected ETEC infection and phagocytosis rates of macrophages. Preincubation of the ETEC pathotype with GP2 reduced the infection of cell lines. Furthermore, preincubation of E. coli with GP2 improved the phagocytosis rate of macrophages. Our findings suggest that GP2 plays a role in the defense against E. coli infection and in the corresponding host immune response.IMPORTANCE Infection by pathogenic bacteria, such as certain Escherichia coli pathotypes, results in diarrhea in mammals. Pathogens, including zoonotic agents, can infect different hosts or show host specificity. There are Escherichia coli strains which are frequently transmitted between humans and animals, whereas other Escherichia coli strains tend to colonize only one host. This host specificity is still not fully understood. We show that glycoprotein 2 is a selective receptor for particular Escherichia coli strains or variants of the adhesin FimH but not a selector for a species-specific Escherichia coli group. We demonstrate that GP2 is involved in the regulation of colonization and infection and thus represents a molecule of interest for the prevention or treatment of disease.},

  abstract = {Amplification curves from quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments typically exhibit a sigmoidal shape. They can roughly be divided into a ground or baseline phase, an exponential amplification phase, a linear phase and finally a plateau phase, where in the latter, the PCR product concentration no longer increases. Nevertheless, in some cases the plateau phase displays a negative trend, e.g. in hydrolysis probe assays. This cycle-to-cycle fluorescence decrease is commonly referred to in the literature as the hook effect. Other detection chemistries also exhibit this negative trend, however the underlying molecular mechanisms are different. In this study we present two approaches to automatically detect hook effect-like curvatures based on linear (hookreg) and nonlinear regression (hookregNL). As the hook effect is typical for qPCR data, both algorithms can be employed for the automated identification of regular structured qPCR curves. Therefore, our algorithms streamline quality control, but can also be used for assay optimization or machine learning.},

Despite their diversity, all amyloid proteins can undergo aggregation initiated by short segments called hot spots. To find the patterns defining the hot spots, we trained predictors of amyloidogenicity, using n-grams and random forest classifiers. Since the amyloidogenicity may not depend on the exact sequence of amino acids but on their more general properties, we tested 524,284 reduced amino acid alphabets of different lengths (three to six letters) to find the alphabet providing the best performance in cross-validation. The predictor based on this alphabet, called AmyloGram, was benchmarked against the most popular tools for the detection of amyloid peptides using an external data set and obtained the highest values of performance measures (AUC: 0.90, MCC: 0.63). Our results showed sequential patterns in the amyloids which are strongly correlated with hydrophobicity, a tendency to form β-sheets, and lower flexibility of amino acid residues. Among the most informative n-grams of AmyloGram we identified 15 that were previously confirmed experimentally. AmyloGram is available as the web-server: http://smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/shiny/AmyloGram/and as the R package AmyloGram.

  abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constitute a diverse group of bioactive molecules that provide multicellular organisms with protection against microorganisms, and microorganisms with weaponry for competition. Some AMPs can target cancer cells; thus, they are called anticancer peptides (ACPs). Due to their small size, positive charge, hydrophobicity and amphipathicity, AMPs and ACPs interact with negatively charged components of biological membranes. AMPs preferentially permeabilize microbial membranes, but ACPs additionally target mitochondrial and plasma membranes of cancer cells. The preference towards mitochondrial membranes is explained by their membrane potential, membrane composition resulting from α-proteobacterial origin and the fact that mitochondrial targeting signals could have evolved from AMPs. Taking into account the therapeutic potential of ACPs and millions of deaths due to cancer annually, it is of vital importance to find new cationic peptides that selectively destroy cancer cells. Therefore, to reduce the costs of experimental research, we have created a robust computational tool, CancerGram, that uses n-grams and random forests for predicting ACPs. Compared to other ACP classifiers, CancerGram is the first three-class model that effectively classifies peptides into: ACPs, AMPs and non-ACPs/non-AMPs, with AU1U amounting to 0.89 and a Kappa statistic of 0.65.

The comparison of λ values from several runs is a multiple comparison problem, which can be solved using the binary structure of dPCR data. We propose and evaluate two novel methods based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multiple Ratio Tests (MRT) for comparison of digital PCR experiments. We enriched our MRT framework with computation of simultaneous confidence intervals suitable for comparing multiple dPCR runs. The evaluation of both statistical methods support that MRT is faster and more robust for dPCR experiments performed in large scale. Our theoretical results were confirmed by the analysis of dPCR measurements of dilution series. Both methods were implemented in the dpcR package (v. 0.2) for the open source R statistical computing environment.},

The significance of signal peptides stimulates development of new computational methods for their detection. These methods employ learning systems trained on datasets comprising signal peptides from different types of proteins and taxonomic groups. As a result, the accuracy of predictions are high in the case of signal peptides that are well-represented in databases, but might be low in other, atypical cases. Such atypical signal peptides are present in proteins found in apicomplexan parasites, causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Apicomplexan proteins have a unique amino acid composition due to their AT-biased genomes. Therefore, we designed a new, more flexible and universal probabilistic model for recognition of atypical eukaryotic signal peptides. Our approach called signalHsmm includes knowledge about the structure of signal peptides and physicochemical properties of amino acids. It is able to recognize signal peptides from the malaria parasites and related species more accurately than popular programs. Moreover, it is still universal enough to provide prediction of other signal peptides on par with the best preforming predictors.},

AmpGram is our novel tool for AMP prediction; it outperforms top-ranking AMP classifiers, including AMPScanner, CAMPR3R and iAMPpred.

The lactoferrin and thrombin AMPs were located in the antimicrobial regions clearly detected by AmpGram. Moreover, AmpGram also provides a list of shot 10 amino acid fragments in the antimicrobial regions, along with their probability predictions; these can be used for further studies and the rational design of new AMPs.

  abstract = {Cross-seeding between amyloidogenic proteins in the gut is receiving increasing attention as a possible mechanism for initiation or acceleration of amyloid formation by aggregation-prone proteins such as αSN, which is central in the development of Parkinson’s disease. This is particularly pertinent in view of the growing number of functional (i.e. benign and useful) amyloid proteins discovered in bacteria. Here we identify two functional amyloid proteins, Pr12 and Pr17, in fecal matter from Parkinson’s disease transgenic rats and their wild type counterparts, based on their stability against dissolution by formic acid. Both proteins show robust aggregation into ThT-positive aggregates that contain higher-order β-sheets and have a fibrillar morphology, indicative of amyloid proteins. In addition, Pr17 aggregates formed in vitro showed significant resistance against formic acid, suggesting an ability to form highly stable amyloid. Treatment with proteinase K revealed a protected core of approx. 9 kDa. Neither Pr12 nor Pr17, however, affected αSN aggregation in vitro. Thus, amyloidogenicity does not per se lead to an ability to cross-seed fibrillation of αSN. Our results support the use of proteomics and formic acid to identify amyloid protein in complex mixtures and indicates the existence of numerous functional amyloid proteins in microbiomes. IMPORTANCE The bacterial microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract is increasingly seen as important for human health and disease. One area of particular interest is that of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s which involve pathological aggregation into amyloid of human proteins such as α- synuclein (αSN). Bacteria are known to form benign or functional amyloid, some of which may initiate unwanted aggregation of e.g. αSN in the enteric nervous system through cross-seeding via contact with the microbiome. Here we show that the rat microbiome contains several proteins which form this type of amyloid aggregate both in vivo and in vitro. Although the two proteins we investigate in depth do not directly promote αSN aggregation, our work shows that the microbiome potentially harbors a significant number of bacterial amyloid which could play a role in human physiology at various levels.},

  abstract = {The rapid and simultaneous detection of DNA and protein biomarkers is necessary to detect the outbreak of a disease or to monitor a disease. For example, cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of adult mortality worldwide. We have developed a rapidly adaptable platform to assess biomarkers using a microfluidic technology. Our model mimics autoantibodies against three proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cfmDNA) and DNA controls are detected via fluorescence probes. The biomarkers are covalently bound on the surface of size- (11–15 μm) and dual-color encoded microbeads and immobilized as planar layer in a microfluidic chip flow cell. Binding events of target molecules were analyzed by fluorescence measurements with a fully automatized fluorescence microscope (end-point and real-time) developed in house. The model system was optimized for buffers and immobilization strategies of the microbeads to enable the simultaneous detection of protein and DNA biomarkers. All prime target molecules (anti-CRP, anti-BNP, anti-LDL, cfmDNA) and the controls were successfully detected both in independent reactions and simultaneously. In addition, the biomarkers could also be detected in spiked human serum in a similar way as in the optimized buffer system. The detection limit specified by the manufacturer is reduced by at least a factor of five for each biomarker as a result of the antibody detection and kinetic experiments indicate that nearly 50 \% of the fluorescence intensity is achieved within 7 min. For rapid data inspection, we have developed the open source software digilogger, which can be applied for data evaluation and visualization.},

Given these similarities and the fact that the antimicrobial properties of short amyloids have not yet been investigated, we chose a group of potentially antimicrobial short amyloids to verify their impact on bacterial and eukaryotic cells. We used AmpGram, a best-performing AMP classification model, and selected ten amyloids with the highest AMP probability for our experimental research. Our results indicate that four tested amyloids: VQIVCK, VCIVYK, KCWCFT, and GGYLLG, formed aggregates under the conditions routinely used to evaluate peptide antimicrobial properties, but none of the tested amyloids exhibited antimicrobial or cytotoxic properties. Accordingly, they should be included in the negative datasets to train the next-generation AMP prediction models, based on experimentally confirmed AMP and non-AMP sequences. In the article, we also emphasize the importance of reporting non-AMPs, given that only a handful of such sequences have been officially confirmed.},

This trend stems from their cost-effectiveness and reduced immunogenicity, compared to antibodies or recombinant proteins, but also from their ability to dock and interfere with large protein-protein interaction surfaces, and their higher specificity and better biocompatibility relative to organic molecules. Many tools have been developed to understand, predict, and engineer peptide function. However, most state-of-the-art approaches treat peptides only as linear entities and disregard their structural arrangement. Yet, structural details are critical for peptide properties such as solubility, stability, or binding affinities. Recent advances in peptide structure prediction have successfully addressed the scarcity of confidently determined peptide structures.

By comparing all isoforms in the static adhesion assay, FimH variants were assigned to high, low or no-binding phenotypes. This FimH variant-dependent binding was neither specific for one GP2 isoform nor for GP2 in general. However, cell line infection assays revealed fundamental differences: using HEp-2 cells, infection was also FimH variant-specific but mainly independent of human GP2. In contrast, this FimH variant dependency was not obvious using IPEC-J2 cells.

In the case of fimbriae with high prevalence, we analysed sequence variation of FimH, EcpD and CsgA, and showed that different adhesin variants were present in the analysed groups, indicating altered adhesive capabilities of haemolytic and nonhaemolytic E. coli . Analysis of over 1000 haemolytic E. coli genomes revealed that they are pathotypically, genetically and antigenically diverse, but their adhesin and iron acquisition repertoire is associated with genome placement of hlyCABD cluster. Haemolytic E. coli with chromosome-encoded alpha-haemolysin had high frequency of P, S, Auf fimbriae and multiple iron acquisition systems such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, salmochelin, Fec, Sit, Bfd and hemin uptake systems. Haemolytic E. coli with plasmid-encoded alpha-haemolysin had similar adhesin profile to nonpathogenic E. coli, with high prevalence of Stg, Yra, Ygi, Ycb, Ybg, Ycf, Sfm, F9 fimbriae, Paa, Lda, intimin and type 3 secretion system encoding genes.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of publications on Escherichia coli as calf pathogens and the role of calves as reservoir have not been done so far. We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods and biological assays. The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals and was analysed for time courses. Together, 106 papers with 25982 E. coli isolates from 27 countries tested for VAFs were included. F5, F17 and F41 fimbriae and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) – VAFs of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were significantly associated with calf diarrhea. On the contrary, ETEC VAF F4 fimbriae and heat-labile enterotoxin as well as enteropathogenic (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing (STEC), and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were not associated with diarrhea. The prevalence increased overtime for ST-positive isolates, but decreased for F5- and STEC-positive isolates. Our study provides useful information about the history of scientific investigations performed in this domain so far, and helps to define etiological agents of calf disease, and to evaluate calves as reservoir hosts for human pathogenic E. coli.},

  abstract = {Sex determination in mammals is strongly linked to sex chromosomes. In most cases, females possess two copies of X chromosome while males have one X and one Y chromosome. It is assumed that these chromosomes originated from a pair of homologous autosomes, which diverged when recombination between them was suppressed. However, it is still debated why the sex chromosomes stopped recombining and how this process spread out over most part of the chromosomes. To study this problem, we developed a simulation model, in which the recombination rate between the sex chromosomes can freely evolve. We found that the suppression of recombination between the X and Y is spontaneous and proceeds very quickly during the evolution of population, which leads to the degeneration of the Y in males. Interestingly, the degeneration happens only when mating pairs are unfaithful. This evolutionary strategy purifies the X chromosome from defective alleles and leads to the larger number of females than males in the population. In consequence, the reproductive potential of the whole population increases. Our results imply that both the suppression of recombination and the degeneration of Y chromosome may be associated with reproductive strategy and favoured in polygamous populations with faithless mating partners.},

  abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, yet effective treatments able to stop or delay disease progression remain elusive. The aggregation of a presynaptic protein, α-synuclein (aSyn), is the primary neurological hallmark of PD and, thus, a promising target for therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of consensus on the molecular properties required to specifically bind the toxic species formed during aSyn aggregation has hindered the development of therapeutic molecules. Recently, we defined and experimentally validated a peptide architecture that demonstrated high affinity and selectivity in binding to aSyn toxic oligomers and fibrils, effectively preventing aSyn pathogenic aggregation. Human peptides with such properties may have neuroprotective activities and hold a huge therapeutic interest. Driven by this idea, here, we developed a discriminative algorithm for the screening of human endogenous neuropeptides, antimicrobial peptides and diet-derived bioactive peptides with the potential to inhibit aSyn aggregation. We identified over 100 unique biogenic peptide candidates and ensembled a comprehensive database (aSynPEP-DB) that collects their physicochemical features, source datasets and additional therapeutic-relevant information, including their sites of expression and associated pathways. Besides, we provide access to the discriminative algorithm to extend its application to the screening of artificial peptides or new peptide datasets. aSynPEP-DB is a unique repository of peptides with the potential to modulate aSyn aggregation, serving as a platform for the identification of previously unexplored therapeutic agents.Database URL: ~https://asynpepdb.ppmclab.com/},

  abstract = {Motivation: Both the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative isothermal amplification (qIA) are standard methods for nucleic acid quantification. Numerous real-time read-out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification-based techniques, there are only few tools for pre-processing of amplification data. However, a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example, during the development of new instruments.Results: ~chipPCR is an R package for the pre-processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplification curves. The package takes advantage of R’s S4 object model and offers an extensible environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R, such as a 5-point stencil for derivative interpolation.

The real-time PCR data markup language (RDML) is a recommended standard of the minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines.

  abstract = {Bacterial biofilm formation is a widespread phenomenon and a complex process requiring a set of genes facilitating the initial adhesion, maturation, and production of the extracellular polymeric matrix and subsequent dispersal of bacteria. Most studies on Escherichia coli biofilm formation have investigated nonpathogenic E. coli K-12 strains. Due to the extensive focus on laboratory strains in most studies, there is poor information regarding biofilm formation by pathogenic E. coli isolates. In this study, we genotypically and phenotypically characterized 187 human clinical E. coli isolates representing various pathotypes (e.g., uropathogenic, enteropathogenic, and enteroaggregative E. coli). We investigated the presence of biofilm-associated genes (“genotype”) and phenotypically analyzed the isolates for motility and curli and cellulose production (“phenotype”). We developed a new screening method to examine the in vitro biofilm formation ability. In summary, we found a high prevalence of biofilm-associated genes. However, we could not detect a biofilm-associated gene or specific phenotype correlating with the biofilm formation ability. In contrast, we did identify an association of increased biofilm formation with a specific E. coli pathotype. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) was found to exhibit the highest capacity for biofilm formation. Using our image-based technology for the screening of biofilm formation, we demonstrated the characteristic biofilm formation pattern of EAEC, consisting of thick bacterial aggregates. In summary, our results highlight the fact that biofilm-promoting factors shown to be critical for biofilm formation in nonpathogenic strains do not reflect their impact in clinical isolates and that the ability of biofilm formation is a defined characteristic of EAEC.IMPORTANCE Bacterial biofilms are ubiquitous and consist of sessile bacterial cells surrounded by a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix. They cause chronic and device-related infections due to their high resistance to antibiotics and the host immune system. In nonpathogenic Escherichia coli, cell surface components playing a pivotal role in biofilm formation are well known. In contrast, there is poor information for their role in biofilm formation of pathogenic isolates. Our study provides insights into the correlation of biofilm-associated genes or specific phenotypes with the biofilm formation ability of commensal and pathogenic E. coli. Additionally, we describe a newly developed method enabling qualitative biofilm analysis by automated image analysis, which is beneficial for high-throughput screenings. Our results help to establish a better understanding of E. coli biofilm formation.},

  abstract = {Due to their complex history, plastids possess proteins encoded in the nuclear and plastid genome. Moreover, these proteins localize to various subplastid compartments. Since protein localization is associated with its function, prediction of subplastid localization is one of the most important steps in plastid protein annotation, providing insight into their potential function. Therefore, we create a novel manually curated data set of plastid proteins and build an ensemble model for prediction of protein subplastid localization. Moreover, we discuss problems associated with the task, e.g. data set sizes and homology reduction. PlastoGram classifies proteins as nuclear- or plastid-encoded and predicts their localization considering: envelope, stroma, thylakoid membrane or thylakoid lumen; for the latter, the import pathway is also predicted. We also provide an additional function to differentiate nuclear-encoded inner and outer membrane proteins. PlastoGram is available as a web server at https://biogenies.info/PlastoGramand as an R package at https://github.com/BioGenies/PlastoGram.

Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data.We obtained published high-replicate qPCR data sets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and AE.Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and AE considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all qPCR scenarios. The Savitzky–Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in qPCR AE, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an AE-dependent bias.The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time PCR experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic qPCR applications. The findings of our study were implemented in the R packages chipPCR and qpcR as a basis for the implementation of an analytical strategy.},

  abstract = {Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data are found to display periodic patterns in the fluorescence intensity as a function of sample number for fixed cycle number. This behavior is seen for technical replicate datasets recorded on several different commercial instruments; it occurs in the baseline region and typically increases with increasing cycle number in the growth and plateau regions. Autocorrelation analysis reveals periodicities of 12 for 96-well systems and 24 for a 384-well system, indicating a correlation with block architecture. Passive dye experiments show that the effect may be from optical detector bias. Importantly, the signal periodicity manifests as periodicity in quantification cycle (Cq) values when these are estimated by the widely applied fixed threshold approach, but not when scale-insensitive markers like first- and second-derivative maxima are used. Accordingly, any scale variability in the growth curves will lead to bias in constant-threshold-based Cqs, making it mandatory that workers should either use scale-insensitive Cqs or normalize their growth curves to constant amplitude before applying the constant threshold method.},

Although CsgA sequences are highly conserved, they exhibit species diversity, which reflects the specific evolutionary and functional adaptability of the major curli subunit. Herein, we performed bioinformatics analyses to uncover the differences in the amyloidogenic properties of the R4 fragments in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica and proposed four mutants for more detailed studies: M1, M2, M3, and M4. The mutated sequences were characterized by various experimental techniques, such as circular dichroism, ATR-FTIR, FT-Raman, thioflavin T, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to determine the role of buffer ions in the aggregation process. Our results demonstrated that the aggregation kinetics, fibril morphology, and overall structure of the peptide were significantly affected by the positions of charged amino acids within the repeat sequences of CsgA. Notably, substituting glycine with lysine resulted in the formation of distinctive spherically packed globular aggregates. The differences in morphology observed are attributed to the influence of phosphate ions, which disrupt the local electrostatic interaction network of the polypeptide chains. This study provides knowledge on the preferential formation of amyloid fibrils based on charge states within the polypeptide chain.},

Its amyloid propensity is defined by five fragments (R1–R5) of the sequence, representing non-perfect repeats. Gate-keeper amino acid residues, specific to each fragment, define the fragment’s propensity for self-aggregation and aggregating characteristics of the whole protein. We study the self-aggregation and secondary structures of the repeat fragments of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli and comparatively analyze their potential effects on these proteins in a bacterial biofilm. Using bioinformatics predictors, ATR-FTIR and FT-Raman spectroscopy techniques, circular dichroism, and transmission electron microscopy, we confirmed self-aggregation of R1, R3, R5 fragments, as previously reported for Escherichia coli, however, with different temporal characteristics for each species. We also observed aggregation propensities of R4 fragment of Salmonella enterica that is different than that of Escherichia coli. Our studies showed that amyloid structures of CsgA repeats are more easily formed and more durable in Salmonella enterica than those in Escherichia coli.},

While initially focused on the study of biodiversity within these communities, the emphasis has increasingly shifted to the study of (changes in) the complete set of functions available in these communities. A key tool to study this functional complement of a microbiome is Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. However, comparing large sets of GO terms is not an easy task due to the deeply branched nature of GO, which limits the utility of exact term matching. To solve this problem, we here present MegaGO, a user-friendly tool that relies on semantic similarity between GO terms to compute the functional similarity between multiple data sets. MegaGO is high performing: Each set can contain thousands of GO terms, and results are calculated in a matter of seconds. MegaGO is available as a web application at https://megago.ugent.be and is installable via pip as a standalone command line tool and reusable software library.

  abstract = {Human S100B is a small, multifunctional protein. Its activity, inside and outside cells, contributes to the biology of the brain, muscle, skin, and adipocyte tissues. Overexpression of S100B occurs in Down Syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, epilepsy, melanoma, myocardial infarction, muscle disorders, and sarcopenia. Modulating the activities of S100B, related to human diseases, without disturbing its physiological functions, is vital for drug and therapy design. This work focuses on the extracellular activity of S100B and one of its receptors, the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE). The functional outcome of extracellular S100B, partially, depends on the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we used Biotin Switch Technique enrichment and mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to show that the appearance of the S100B protein in the extracellular milieu of the mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and expression of the membrane-bound RAGE receptor, lead to changes in the intracellular S-nitrosylation of, at least, more than a hundred proteins. Treatment of the wild-type CHO cells with nanomolar or micromolar concentrations of extracellular S100B modulates the sets of S-nitrosylation targets inside cells. The cellular S-nitrosome is tuned differently, depending on the presence or absence of stable RAGE receptor expression. The presented results are a proof-of-concept study, suggesting that S-nitrosylation, like other post-translational modifications, should be considered in future research, and in developing tailored therapies for S100B and RAGE receptor-related diseases.},
