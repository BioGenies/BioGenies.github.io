## Conference Highlights 📚

We attended a series of fascinating presentations throughout the event. But the standout? **Kasia**'s talk on *Strain-resolved metagenomics in analysis of gut microbiota dynamics within families* stole the show, at least for us!

Of course, we also couldn't miss **Weronika**'s impressive poster presentation!

## Post-Conference Adventures 🌆🍦

After a packed first day, we set out to grab some ice cream to unwind, but, to our surprise, every shop was closed! During the adventure of hunting for an open place, we even temporarily "lost" **Jarek** and **Krysia** for a bit! 😅

And finally, the ultimate highlight—our fun-filled **BioGenies** reunion! Catching up with old friends and creating new memories was the perfect end to an incredible conference.
