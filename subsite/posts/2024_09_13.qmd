We attended a series of fascinating presentations, but our **Kasia**‚Äôs talk, *Strain-resolved metagenomics in analysis of gut microbiota dynamics within families*, was definitely a standout moment!

Of course, we couldn't miss out on admiring Weronika's impressive poster presentation.

After the first day, we planned to grab some ice cream to unwind, but every shop was closed! In the adventure of searching for a place, we even temporarily "lost" **Jarek** and **Krysia**.

The absolute highlight of the event? A fun-filled BioGenies reunion! We had a blast catching up and making memories.
