# 🎉 HUPO 2024 conference wrap-up 🎉

Our BioGenies team – Michał, Jarek, Krysia, Weronika, and Oriol – had an unforgettable week at **HUPO 2024 in Dresden**! Here's the highlight reel:

## 🏙️ Sunday: arrival & sightseeingg
We started the week with a stroll to explore the conference site and snapped a photo of the iconic Yenidze, a former cigarette factory with a unique design 🕌.

## 🎊 Opening ceremony & networking
Sunday night kicked off with the **opening ceremony** and welcome reception 🍾, followed by an **Early Career Researchers Networking Night**. Despite the darkness on our boat tour 🌌, we made the most of it by networking with fellow researchers. The highlight? Watching as they joined two boats together – an unexpected twist to the night! 🚢

We carved out some time to visit the famous **Bastei Bridge**. Though the heavy fog limited the view 🌫️, it added a mystique that made for an unforgettable (and chilly) adventure! 🏞️

## ✈️ Oriol's travel twist
Oriol’s return flight was suddenly canceled due to an airport strike 😱. But no worries – Michał, Jarek, and Weronika swooped in 🚗, picking him up from his hotel to drive him back to the airport.

## 🏰 Friday: Dresdner Zwinger exploration
After the conference wrapped up, Weronika and Jarek spent Friday exploring the beautiful **Dresdner Zwinger** – a perfect way to close out a memorable week of science and sightseeing 🏛️✨.
