We're excited to share that our team members Michał, Valen, and Jarek have embarked on an incredible journey to Thessaloniki, Greece, to attend the 2nd Machine Learning for Non-Globular Proteins conference! 🤖🧬

This conference brings together leading experts and innovators to explore the latest advancements in applying machine learning techniques to understand and predict the behavior of non-globular proteins. It's a fantastic opportunity for BioGenies to connect with global researchers, exchange ideas, and bring back cutting-edge knowledge to enhance our ongoing projects.
