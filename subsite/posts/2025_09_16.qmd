# 📚 What was the thesis about? 🧾

Biomedical science produces *mountains of publications* every year 📈📖. But finding the truly relevant papers, especially those about amyloids 🧩 and antibodies 🧪, can be *slow and exhausting* 😵.  

Sonor set out to change that! 🚀✨ His thesis explored **AI-powered text classification** to help researchers filter the noise and find the gems 💎.  

---

# 🤖 How did he do it? ⚙️

📝 Compared **classical ML** models (logistic regression, random forest 🌲) with **transformer-based language models** (BioMedBERT, SapBERT, BioMed RoBERTa 🧬🤖).  
🔎 Built a system that uses **titles, abstracts, and journal names** to decide if a paper is relevant.  
🌐 Automated the process by pulling data straight from **PubMed 🩺📚**.  

---

# 🚀 What did he achieve? 🏆

✨ Reduced manual curation time drastically ⏱️⬇️.  
✨ Improved the ratio of relevant papers found by over **350%** 📈🔥.  
✨ Created a tool that works like a **supercharged search engine** for biomedical literature 💡🔍.  

In simple words: Sonor built a system that helps scientists **find the right papers faster** ⚡📚💪.
