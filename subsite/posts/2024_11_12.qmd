## 🧑‍💻 Bringing bioinformatics and biotechnology together

Mariia’s hands-on background in biotechnology will be gathering and organizing data on **antibody-amyloid interactions**. This project holds exciting potential for insights into **therapeutic small molecule design** and understanding amyloid diseases at a molecular level. As she transitions to bioinformatics, Mariia will bring her analytical skills into action with our team’s support.

Welcome aboard, Mariia! 🎉 We’re thrilled to have you in the BioGenies and excited to see the discoveries you and Valen will make together.
