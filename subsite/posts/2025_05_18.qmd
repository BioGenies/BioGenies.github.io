## 🔁 Shifting gears – Python to C++

"Our favorite ML master is **shifting focus to C++**, diving deep into performance-heavy projects. It’s a big leap, but if anyone can handle that kind of compute muscle-flexing, it’s **Jakub**.

> “Less time for BioGenies… but still a BioGenie.” 💙  
> We’ll take it!

## 🥐🥗🍣 The perks? Insider scoop!

The rumors are true – **Google takes care of its people**. Jakub reports:

- ✅ Free **breakfast**, **lunch**, **dinner**, and even **supper** 🍳🍱🍜
- ✅ Access to a **gym** to burn all those free calories 💪
- ❌ But don't try to crash overnight ,you'll **get kicked out** 😅

Almost sounds like a place you could live in… if only they'd let you stay past bedtime!

We’re super proud of Jakub and his journey from lab notebooks to massive production servers. We miss you in the daily grind, but once a BioGenie – **always** a BioGenie. 💙🚀
