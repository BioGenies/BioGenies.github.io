We are proud to announce that MichaÅ‚ has been awarded the prestigious NCN Sonata 19 grant for his  project titled "Taming aggregation with AmyloGraph 2.0: a database and prediction models of amyloid self-assembly modulators" ðŸ§¬âœ¨

This innovative research will focus on expanding AmyloGraph, a comprehensive amyloid interactions database aimed at understanding and controlling the self-assembly of amyloid proteins. MichaÅ‚'s work promises to make significant contributions to the field of protein aggregation, with potential implications for tackling diseases linked to amyloid formation.

We have planned three new positions for the project. Stay tuned for the announcement at the end of summer vacation!
