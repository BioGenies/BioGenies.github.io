# 🤝 Welcoming Prof. Krzysztof Poterłowicz (ELIXIR‑UK) to our lab! 🎉

We’re thrilled to host **Prof. Krzysztof Poterlowicz** from the **University of Bradford**, a key connector for **ELIXIR‑UK** as their Training Coordinator and UK Node's DaSH fellowship PI. Krzysztof brings rich expertise in **FAIR data stewardship**, **Galaxy Training**, and practical implementation of ELIXIR standards.

## 🎯 Why his visit matters

Poland is not yet a formal **ELIXIR** member, and Krzysztof's visit is a major step in our lab’s push toward joining the infrastructure. During his stay, we were discussing another MSCA Staff Exchanges project, the TAPESTRY! 🛠🌍️

We’re honored to welcome Krzysztof and grateful for the strategic support he brings 🙌
