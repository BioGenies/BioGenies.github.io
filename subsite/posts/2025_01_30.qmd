## 🧪 Another great scientist leaving academia

It is always sad to see **another great researcher leaving academia**. Eva has an incredible mind, and the academic world is losing a talented scientist. But wherever she goes next, we know she will **make a difference** and **continue to excel**! 💙

Eva, we wish you all the best in your future adventures! 🚀💙
