# 🎓 The big day

The defence took place at the **Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IBB PAS)** 🏛️🧬  

Weronika walked the committee through the world of **high-resolution hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/DX) mass spectrometry**, a powerful way to study protein dynamics and structure at an incredibly detailed level 📈🧪  

After a successful defence and the news of the **distinction** 🥇, there was a small celebration at IBB PAS 🎂☕ , the perfect way to close this long PhD journey.

# 🍕 Night party with (cardboard) Michał 😄

Of course, one party was definitely **not enough** for Weronika 😎. So we organised another celebration with:  

**Weronika** and **Tomek**, **Jarek**, **Jakub**, **Dominik**, **Kasia**, **Mariia**, **Julia** and…  
**cardboard Michał** 😅, because real Michał was at **BioHackathon 2025 in Berlin**, but we still wanted him “there” for the photos 📸🧍♂️🧻

👨🍳 **Jarek made pizza**, lots of it 🍕🔥  
We ate, talked, laughed and shared stories **the whole night** 🌙💬. It was the perfect mix of science gossip, future plans and pure chill.

# 🍲 Hot pot, Marcinek & Thursday follow-up

And because **good news deserves several rounds of celebration**…  

On **Thursday**, when **Krysia** could finally make it to Warsaw, we had yet another mini-party with **Weronika**, **Krysia** and **Jarek**:

- We went out for **hot pot** 🍲🔥 — perfect comfort food + gossip combo  
- Then headed to **Weronika’s place** for dessert: the legendary **Marcinek cake** 🎂 (leftover from Tuesday, but still absolutely top tier 😋)  
- And, of course, more long conversations, laughs and decompression after the rollercoaster of the defence week 💬💛
