# 🧪🎊 New open-access article: **LLPS benchmarking bonanza**!

We’re thrilled to announce our latest study, **Comprehensive protein datasets and benchmarking for liquid–liquid phase separation studies**, is now online in **Genome Biology***! 📘🔥

- **Published**: 8 July 2025 
- **Lead author**: **Carlos** (huge kudos to Salva’s team!)

## 🌟 What’s inside?

LLPS (liquid–liquid phase separation) drives biomolecular condensates, crucial for cellular function. But variability across LLPS databases makes modeling tricky. This study tackles that challenge by:

- Collecting **comprehensive protein datasets** across multiple LLPS repositories  
- Creating **benchmark frameworks** to evaluate predictor performance  
- Defining a reliable set of **negative (non-LLPS) proteins** for fair model assessment 

The goal? To enable **transparent, reproducible, and robust ML-driven insights** into protein phase behavior.

## 🎯 Why it matters

- **Harmonization**: brings together divergent LLPS resources for interoperability 
- **Model reliability**: improves confidence in ML predictions with curated benchmarks  
- **Research enabler**: helps the broader community build and validate new tools for condensate biology

By offering standardized datasets and robust benchmarking, this publication sets a new bar for reproducible ML in LLPS research.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

We’re already leveraging these benchmarking datasets in our ongoing **LLPS and amyloid research**.. If you're into biomolecular condensates or predictive modeling, this resource is for you!
