# 🎤 Talks, posters & flash talks

- **Michał** and **Valen** delivered fantastic talks 💪👏.  
- **Mariia**, **Asia** and **Jarek** joined the poster + flash talk sessions, presenting their projects and sharing insights like pros! 🖼️🔬  

Special shout-out to **Asia** 🙌: her presentation file got corrupted right before her talk 😱💻💥… but she still gave a **super talk without slides**! 💯🔥 That’s what we call true conference skills 🥷✨.

# 🍲 Food, food… and more food

As always, PTBI wasn’t just about science, it was also about **eating A LOT** 😋🍝🍰. Coffee breaks, conference dinner, late-night snacks… we powered through it all.  

And since it was Białystok, of course we **ended with pancakes 🥞💚**. A proper BioGenies tradition!
