We’re thrilled to share that the BioGenies team from the University of Wrocław, including Krysia, Asia, and Filip, recently visited our BioGenies HQ in Białystok! 🏢🤝

During this productive visit, we collaborated on exciting projects and celebrated our hard work. But that’s not all! The team also took the opportunity to explore the stunning Białowieża Primeval Forest, immersing themselves in its natural beauty and historical significance. 🌳🌲

As a highlight of the trip, the team gave an engaging interview on TV but only Krysia was shown. 📺✨
