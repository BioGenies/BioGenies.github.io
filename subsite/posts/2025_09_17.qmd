🥳 **Fantastic news, Mariia is now officially a PhD student!** She has joined the **international doctoral programme** at the Medical University of Białystok 🌍🎓. We couldn’t be more excited to see her continue her journey with us and take on such an important project! 💚🧬

# 🕷️ What will Mariia work on?

Her PhD project is titled:  
**“Development of Bioinformatics Methods for the Study of Tick-Borne Diseases”**

Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) like Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and tick-borne encephalitis are a growing health threat in Europe ⚠️. Climate change 🌦️, land-use patterns 🏞 and expanding tick habitats mean more people are at risk. Co-infections make diagnosis and treatment even trickier.

Mariia’s mission:  

✨ Build **databases and interactive maps** 📊🗺️ to track ticks and pathogens.  
✨ Develop **machine learning models** 🤖 to predict infection risk after a tick bite.  
✨ Analyze **omics data** 🧬 to find biomarkers that improve diagnosis and guide treatments.  
✨ Study how **co-infections** and different treatment methods impact patient outcomes.

# 🔬 Collaboration & impact

This project will be carried out in close collaboration with the **OneTick consortium** 🤝, led by Professor Anna Moniuszko-Malinowska and our very own Michał Burdukiewicz. With access to unique clinical, epidemiological and omics datasets, Mariia’s research will:  

- Provide **new biomarkers** to better diagnose TBDs.  
- Offer **predictive models** to support clinicians.  
- Help design **evidence-based public health strategies** to monitor and manage tick-borne diseases. 🏥🌍
