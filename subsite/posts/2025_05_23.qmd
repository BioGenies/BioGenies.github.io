## 🧬 What’s inside?

Cross-interactions between amyloid proteins are a **key factor** in many diseases, from Alzheimer's to prion diseases. Yet, capturing the full picture of these interactions remains a major experimental challenge.

In this comprehensive review, we:

- 🔬 Survey the most widely used **(*in vitro*) and in vivo methods** to study amyloid cross-interactions  
- 💡 Discuss how each method contributes unique (but partial) insights, from **aggregation kinetics** to **fibril morphology** and **hetero-aggregate composition**  
- 📷 Highlight the **complementarity** of techniques such as:
  - Thioflavin T fluorescence
  - AFM, Cryo-EM, immuno-TEM
  - Mass spectrometry & solid-state NMR
  - Co-immunoprecipitation and super-resolution imaging

📊 And we emphasize: **no single method is enough**, it’s only through **hybrid strategies** that we can start to decode the complexity of amyloid cross-interactions.

## 📌 Key takeaway:
> “The only recommended approach is to combine indirect and direct evidence to create a more complete outlook of this process.”

Whether you're developing new tools, studying amyloid polymorphism or exploring proteinopathies, we hope this work helps chart the path toward better experimental designs and interpretations.
