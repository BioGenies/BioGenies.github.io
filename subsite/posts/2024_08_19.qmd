## About the Project
Amyloids are proteins implicated in numerous serious diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, and type 2 diabetes. These proteins are known for their ability to self-aggregate into unique supramolecular fibrils, a process that plays a critical role in disease progression.

Our team has previously developed AmyloGraph, database of amyloid interactions, which you can explore [here](https://amylograph.com/). In this new phase of our research, we aim to take AmyloGraph to the next level. We will design and implement machine learning-based tools to analyze the data more effectively and revamp the user interface to make it easier for researchers to access the latest information.

But that’s not all. The data collected during this project will be used to train predictive models, with the ultimate goal of designing new chemical compounds that can inhibit amyloid self-aggregation. These compounds hold great promise for the treatment of various amyloid-related diseases.
