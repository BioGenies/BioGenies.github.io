## ðŸ§¬ AmyloGraph 2.0: Taming aggregation

**Taming aggregation with AmyloGraph 2.0: a database and prediction models of amyloid selfâ€‘assembly modulators**

**PI**: MichaÅ‚  
**Funding agency**: National Science Center Poland  
**Programme**: Sonata 19  
**Project ID**: 2023/51/D/NZ7/02847  
**Start date**: 10 Jul 2024  
**Duration**: 36 months  
**Budget**: 1,797,914.00 PLN (~ â‚¬423,300.00) 


Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (~5.8 M U.S. cases in 2019, projected 13.8 M by 2050) and Parkinson's are proteinopathies marked by harmful amyloid aggregation. Existing tools, Cordax, PASTA 2.0, WALTZ, AmyloGram, predict single-protein aggregation but donâ€™t model modulation by experimental conditions or small molecules.

AmyloGraph 1.0 cataloged amyloidâ€“amyloid interactions, though limited to proteinâ€“protein modulators without context. The more recent aSynPEPâ€‘DB collects peptide inhibitors of Î±â€‘synuclein aggregation, yet is constrained to peptides, inhibitors and a single target.

### ðŸ“Œ Project highlights

- âž• Expand the database to include non-protein modulators with experimental metadata  
- ðŸ§  Train ML models to predict aggregation modulation  
- ðŸ§¬ Build generative models for novel modulators and validate them computationally and experimentally
