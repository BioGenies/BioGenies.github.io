## 🧠 Importance of human microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases

**LIMAD: Large-scale identification of microorganism products impacting amyloid diseases**

**PI**: Valen  
**Funding agency**: National Science Center Poland  
**Programme**: Miniatura 9  
**Grant ID**: 2025/09/X/NZ7/00600  
**Start date**:  21 Aug 2025  
**Duration**: 12 months  
**Budget**: PLN49,999.00   


Protein aggregation and amyloid deposits are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as **Alzheimer’s (AD)** and **Parkinson’s (PD)**. Emerging evidence suggests that **microbial proteins** can influence the misfolding of human amyloidogenic proteins (notably **Aβ42** and **α-synuclein**), potentially via the gut–brain axis. **LIMAD** aims to systematically uncover microbial proteins with amyloid potential and evaluate their ability to **interact with and promote aggregation** of Aβ42 and α-synuclein.


### 📌 Project highlights
