## 🧠 Missing values distort multi-omics analyses

**imputomics 2.0: comprehensive framework for missing value imputation in multi-omics data**

**PI**: Jarek  
**Funding agency**: National Science Center Poland 
**Programme**: Miniatura 9 
**Grant ID**: 2025/09/X/NZ7/00157 
**Start date**: 25 Jun 2025
**Duration**: 12 months  
**Budget**: €49,999.00  

Missing values are pervasive in **omics** (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) and can compromise downstream analyses. **Missing-value imputation algorithms (MVIAs)** attempt to replace missing entries with plausible estimates. Given the diversity of data types and the sheer number of methods, choosing the right MVIA remains challenging.

Building on **imputomics 1.0** (web server + R package) — where we conducted an extensive preliminary benchmark, **imputomics 2.0** generalizes the framework to **multi-omics**, integrates **state-of-the-art MVIAs**, and provides a **curated repository** of methods and datasets.

### 📌 Project highlights

- 📚 Comprehensive review of missing value imputation algorithms (MVIAs)  
- 🗂️ Standardized annotation of omics-specific imputation methods  
- ⚙️ Universal wrapper for seamless integration across genomics, proteomics, metabolomics & more  
- 📊 Benchmarking with multiple metrics (RMSE, correlation, interpretability, downstream tasks)  
- 🌐 Building an open **repository** of MVIAs + datasets for the research community
