## ðŸ§¬ OneTick: One Health approach to tickâ€‘borne diseases

**OneTick: An Integrated One Health Approach for Prevention, Detection and Treatment of Tickâ€‘Borne Diseases in Urban and Periâ€‘Urban Environments**

**PI**: MichaÅ‚
**Proposal development**: MichaÅ‚, Jarek, Valen  
**Grant ID**: 101236599  
**Start Date**: 1 Jan 2026  
**Duration**: 48 months  
**EU Contribution**: â‚¬450,900.00  

Tickâ€‘borne diseases (TBDs) such as Lyme disease and TBE are on the rise in Europe due to shifts in climate and urbanization. In 2022, some 24% of Europeans resided in highâ€‘risk Lyme areas, and the ECDC estimated ~360,000 cases in 2016, costing about â‚¬280M annually. OneTick advances prevention, detection and treatment within a One Health framework, targeting urban and periâ€‘urban areas.

### ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- ðŸ”¬ **WP1**: Urban tick ecology â€” assess abundance, diversity, and pathogens  
- ðŸ“ˆ **WP2**: Tickâ€“hostâ€“pathogen modeling â€” predictive frameworks for disease spread  
- ðŸ§ª **WP3**: Biomarker discovery & diagnostic modeling  
- ðŸ“£ **WP4**: Public outreach â€” guidelines and educational campaigns  
- ðŸ‘¥ **Secondments**: 90 PM (60 intersectoral, 30 interdisciplinary) to share best practices
