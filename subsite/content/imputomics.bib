  abstract = {Necessary steps need to be taken in order to cushion the effects of hunger, famine, and drought in the world. To ameliorate these challenges, biotechnological innovations like meta-omics techniques have been employed in crop improvement programs. Metabolomics is a viable technology to fully detect the functional network of metabolites with far-reaching biological uses in agriculture, medicine, and pharmaceutical disciplines. This review is grouped into four sections discussing 1) plant and microbial metabolomics, 2) metabolomics and its application in crop production, 3) metabolomics workflow and techniques explaining the analytical techniques and instrumentation with merits and demerits, and 4) metabolomic analysis of metabolites in a metabolic network. This technology has been applied in plant-microbe interaction, biological control measures, and abiotic stress tolerance, where various crops like maize, sunflower, soybean, and wheat have been used. In view of all these, further, development is needed to increase our understanding of microbial metabolites in order to develop bioproducts that will increase growth and eventual yield, protecting plants from pathogens and in the process providing nutritious food for the teeming populace. Although metabolomics can be applied to a wide range of scientific areas, we focus this review on plant improvement, which is a driver for improved food security.},

A total of 654 grain and 695 forage samples from 50 genetically diverse non-GM DuPont Pioneer maize hybrids grown at six locations in the U.S. and Canada were analyzed by coupled gas chromatography time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS). A total of 156 and 185 metabolites were measured in grain and forage samples, respectively. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were employed extensively to compare and correlate the metabolite profiles. We show that the environment had far more impact on the forage metabolome compared to the grain metabolome, and the environment affected up to 50\% of the metabolites compared to less than 2\% by the genetic background. The findings from this study demonstrate that the combination of GC/TOF-MS metabolomics and comprehensive multivariate statistical analysis is a powerful approach to identify the sources of natural variation contributed by the environment and genotype.}

High-throughput quantification of small-molecules in bio-samples, i.e. `metabolomics', is steadily gaining popularity, as it is highly informative for various phenotypical characteristics. Here we aim to leverage metabolomics to impute missing data in clinical variables routinely assessed in large epidemiological and clinical studies. Methods To this end, we have employed {$\sim$}26,000 1H-NMR metabolomics samples from 28 Dutch cohorts collected within the BBMRI-NL consortium, to create 19 metabolomics-based predictors for clinical variables, including diabetes status (AUC5-Fold CV~=~0{$\cdot$}94) and lipid medication usage (AUC5-Fold CV~=~0{$\cdot$}90). Findings Subsequent application in independent cohorts confirmed that our metabolomics-based predictors can indeed be used to impute a wide array of missing clinical variables from a single metabolomics data resource. In addition, application highlighted the potential use of our predictors to explore the effects of totally unobserved confounders in omics association studies. Finally, we show that our predictors can be used to explore risk factor profiles contributing to mortality in older participants. Interpretation To conclude, we provide 1H-NMR metabolomics-based models to impute clinical variables routinely assessed in epidemiological studies and illustrate their merit in scenarios when phenotypic variables are partially incomplete or totally unobserved.

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

  abstract = {Missing data is a significant issue in metabolomics that is often neglected when conducting data preprocessing, particularly when it comes to imputation. This can have serious implications for downstream statistical analyses and lead to misleading or uninterpretable inferences. In this study, we aim to identify the primary types of missingness that affect untargeted metabolomics data and compare strategies for imputation using two real-world comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC {\texttimes} GC) data sets. We also present these goals in the context of experimental replication whereby imputation is conducted in a within-replicate-based fashion-the first description and evaluation of this strategy-and introduce an R package MetabImpute to carry out these analyses. Our results conclude that, in these two GC {\texttimes} GC data sets, missingness was most likely of the missing at-random (MAR) and missing not-at-random (MNAR) types as opposed to missing completely at-random (MCAR). Gibbs sampler imputation and Random Forest gave the best results when imputing MAR and MNAR compared against single-value imputation (zero, minimum, mean, median, and half-minimum) and other more sophisticated approaches (Bayesian principal component analysis and quantile regression imputation for left-censored data). When samples are replicated, within-replicate imputation approaches led to an increase in the reproducibility of peak quantification compared to imputation that ignores replication, suggesting that imputing with respect to replication may preserve potentially important features in downstream analyses for biomarker discovery.}

  abstract = {Abstract             When analyzing large datasets from high-throughput technologies, researchers often encounter missing quantitative measurements, which are particularly frequent in metabolomics datasets. Metabolomics, the comprehensive profiling of metabolite abundances, are typically measured using mass spectrometry technologies that often introduce missingness via multiple mechanisms: (1) the metabolite signal may be smaller than the instrument limit of detection; (2) the conditions under which the data are collected and processed may lead to missing values; (3) missing values can be introduced randomly. Missingness resulting from mechanism (1) would be classified as Missing Not At Random (MNAR), that from mechanism (2) would be Missing At Random (MAR), and that from mechanism (3) would be classified as Missing Completely At Random (MCAR). Two common approaches for handling missing data are the following: (1) omit missing data from the analysis; (2) impute the missing values. Both approaches may introduce bias and reduce statistical power in downstream analyses such as testing metabolite associations with clinical variables. Further, standard imputation methods in metabolomics often ignore the mechanisms causing missingness and inaccurately estimate missing values within a data set. We propose a mechanism-aware imputation algorithm that leverages a two-step approach in imputing missing values. First, we use a random forest classifier to classify the missing mechanism for each missing value in the data set. Second, we impute each missing value using imputation algorithms that are specific to the predicted missingness mechanism (i.e., MAR/MCAR or MNAR). Using complete data, we conducted simulations, where we imposed different missingness patterns within the data and tested the performance of combinations of imputation algorithms. Our proposed algorithm provided imputations closer to the original data than those using only one imputation algorithm for all the missing values. Consequently, our two-step approach was able to reduce bias for improved downstream analyses.},

In large metabolite panels, measurement values are frequently missing and, if neglected or sub-optimally imputed, can cause biased study results. We provided a publicly available, user-friendly R script to streamline the imputation of missing endogenous, unannotated, and xenobiotic metabolites. We evaluated the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) analyses implemented in our script by simulations using measured metabolites data from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study (n = 599). We simulated missing values in four unique metabolites from different pathways with different correlation structures in three sample sizes (599, 150, 50) with three missing percentages (15\%, 30\%, 60\%), and using two missing mechanisms (completely at random and not at random). Based on the simulations, we found that for MICE, larger sample size was the primary factor decreasing bias and error. For kNN, the primary factor reducing bias and error was the metabolite correlation with its predictor metabolites. MICE provided consistently higher performance measures particularly for larger datasets (n {$>$} 50). In conclusion, we presented an imputation workflow in a publicly available R script to impute untargeted metabolomics data. Our simulations provided insight into the effects of sample size, percentage missing, and correlation structure on the accuracy of the two imputation methods.},

  abstract = {The real-world data analysis and processing using data mining techniques often are facing observations that contain missing values. The main challenge of mining datasets is the existence of missing values. The missing values in a dataset should be imputed using the imputation method to improve the data mining methods' accuracy and performance. There are existing techniques that use k-nearest neighbors algorithm for imputing the missing values but determining the appropriate k value can be a challenging task. There are other existing imputation techniques that are based on hard clustering algorithms. When records are not well-separated, as in the case of missing data, hard clustering provides a poor description tool in many cases. In general, the imputation depending on similar records is more accurate than the imputation depending on the entire dataset's records. Improving the similarity among records can result in improving the imputation performance. This paper proposes two numerical missing data imputation methods. A hybrid missing data imputation method is initially proposed, called KI, that incorporates k-nearest neighbors and iterative imputation algorithms. The best set of nearest neighbors for each missing record is discovered through the records similarity by using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN). To improve the similarity, a suitable k value is estimated automatically for the kNN. The iterative imputation method is then used to impute the missing values of the incomplete records by using the global correlation structure among the selected records. An enhanced hybrid missing data imputation method is then proposed, called FCKI, which is an extension of KI. It integrates fuzzy c-means, k-nearest neighbors, and iterative imputation algorithms to impute the missing data in a dataset. The fuzzy c-means algorithm is selected because the records can belong to multiple clusters at the same time. This can lead to further improvement for similarity. FCKI searches a cluster, instead of the whole dataset, to find the best k-nearest neighbors. It applies two levels of similarity to achieve a higher imputation accuracy. The performance of the proposed imputation techniques is assessed by using fifteen datasets with variant missing ratios for three types of missing data; MCAR, MAR, MNAR. These different missing data types are generated in this work. The datasets with different sizes are used in this paper to validate the model. Therefore, proposed imputation techniques are compared with other missing data imputation methods by means of three measures; the root mean square error (RMSE), the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The results show that the proposed methods achieve better imputation accuracy and require significantly less time than other missing data imputation methods.},

The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available. The program is easy to use, and the simplicity of the algorithm makes it far more robust; both a simple command line and extensive graphical user interface are included.},

  abstract = {Missing values in mass spectrometry metabolomic datasets occur widely and can originate from a number of sources, including for both technical and biological reasons. Currently, little is known about these data, i.e. about their distributions across datasets, the need (or not) to consider them in the data processing pipeline, and most importantly, the optimal way of assigning them values prior to univariate or multivariate data analysis. Here, we address all of these issues using direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data. We have shown that missing data are widespread, accounting for ca. 20\% of data and affecting up to 80\% of all variables, and that they do not occur randomly but rather as a function of signal intensity and mass-to-charge ratio. We have demonstrated that missing data estimation algorithms have a major effect on the outcome of data analysis when comparing the differences between biological sample groups, including by t test, ANOVA and principal component analysis. Furthermore, results varied significantly across the eight algorithms that we assessed for their ability to impute known, but labelled as missing, entries. Based on all of our findings we identified the k-nearest neighbour imputation method (KNN) as the optimal missing value estimation approach for our direct infusion mass spectrometry datasets. However, we believe the wider significance of this study is that it highlights the importance of missing metabolite levels in the data processing pipeline and offers an approach to identify optimal ways of treating missing data in metabolomics experiments.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics, which is the metabolites profiling in biological matrices, is a key tool for biomarker discovery and personalized medicine and has great potential to elucidate the ultimate product of the genomic processes. Over the last decade, metabolomics studies have identified several relevant biomarkers involved in complex clinical phenotypes using diverse biological systems. Most diseases result in signature metabolic profiles that reflect the sums of external and internal cellular activities. Metabolomics has a major role in clinical practice as it represents {$>$}95\% of the workload in clinical laboratories worldwide. Many of these metabolites require different analytical platforms, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Mass Spectrometry (MS), and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC), while many clinically relevant metabolites are still not routinely amenable to detection using currently available assays. Combining metabolomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies will result in a significantly improved understanding of the disease mechanisms and the pathophysiology of the target clinical phenotype. This comprehensive approach will represent a major step forward toward providing precision medical care, in which individual is accounted for variability in genes, environment, and personal lifestyle. In this review, we compare and evaluate the metabolomics strategies and studies that focus on the discovery of biomarkers that have ``personalized'' diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value, validated for monitoring disease progression and responses to various management regimens.},

The importance of data quality has been recognized beyond the field of data engineering and database management systems (DBMSs). Also, for machine learning (ML) applications, high data quality standards are crucial to ensure robust predictive performance and responsible usage of automated decision making. One of the most frequent data quality problems is missing values. Incomplete datasets can break data pipelines and can have a devastating impact on downstream ML applications when not detected. While statisticians and, more recently, ML researchers have introduced a variety of approaches to impute missing values, comprehensive benchmarks comparing classical and modern imputation approaches under fair and realistic conditions are underrepresented. Here, we aim to fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments on a large number of datasets with heterogeneous data and realistic missingness conditions, comparing both novel deep learning approaches and classical ML imputation methods when either only test or train and test data are affected by missing data. Each imputation method is evaluated regarding the imputation quality and the impact imputation has on a downstream ML task. Our results provide valuable insights into the performance of a variety of imputation methods under realistic conditions. We hope that our results help researchers and engineers to guide their data preprocessing method selection for automated data quality improvement.},

However, especially non-targeted metabolite profiling approaches generate vast arrays of data that are prone to aberrations such as missing values. No matter the reason for the missing values in the data, coherent and complete data matrix is always a pre-requisite for accurate and reliable statistical analysis. Therefore, there is a need for proper imputation strategies that account for the missingness and reduce the bias in the statistical analysis.                                         Results               Here we present our results after evaluating nine imputation methods in four different percentages of missing values of different origin. The performance of each imputation method was analyzed by Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE). We demonstrated that random forest (RF) had the lowest NRMSE in the estimation of missing values for Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). In case of absent values due to Missing Not at Random (MNAR), the left truncated data was best imputed with minimum value imputation. We also tested the different imputation methods for datasets containing missing data of various origin, and RF was the most accurate method in all cases. The results were obtained by repeating the evaluation process 100 times with the use of metabolomics datasets where the missing values were introduced to represent absent data of different origin.                                         Conclusion               Type and rate of missingness affects the performance and suitability of imputation methods. RF-based imputation method performs best in most of the tested scenarios, including combinations of different types and rates of missingness. Therefore, we recommend using random forest-based imputation for imputing missing metabolomics data, and especially in situations where the types of missingness are not known in advance.},

Although several missing data imputation techniques are described in the literature, all conventional existing techniques only solve the missing value problems.

The sub-discipline of environmental metabolomics is the application of metabolomic techniques to analyze the interactions of organisms with their environment. There has been a rapid growth in environmental metabolomics over the past decade. This growth can be attributed to the comprehensive and rapid nature of nontargeted metabolomics and the ability to generate hypotheses involving complex environmental stressors, especially when the mode of action is unknown. Using a wide variety of model organisms, metabolomic studies have detected stress from abiotic factors such as xenobiotic exposure and temperature shifts as well as biotic stressors such as herbivory and competition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics has been the dominant analytical platform used for environmental metabolomics studies, owing to its nonselectivity and ease of sample preparation. However, the number of mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic studies is also increasing rapidly, owing to its high sensitivity for the detection of trace levels of metabolites. In this review, we provide an overview of the general experimental design, extraction methods, analytical instrumentation, and statistical methods used in environmental metabolomics. We then highlight some of the recent studies that have used metabolomics to elucidate hitherto unknown biochemical modes of actions of various environmental stressors to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms, as well as identify potential metabolite shifts as early bioindicators of these stressors. Through this, we emphasize the immense potential and versatility of environmental metabolomics as a routine tool for characterizing the responses of organisms to numerous types of environmental stressors.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Missingness in label-free mass spectrometry is inherent to the technology. A computational approach to recover missing values in metabolomics and proteomics datasets is important. Most existing methods are designed under a particular assumption, either missing at random or under the detection limit. If the missing pattern deviates from the assumption, it may lead to biased results. Hence, we investigate the missing patterns in free mass spectrometry data and develop an omnibus approach GMSimpute, to allow effective imputation accommodating different missing patterns.                                         Results               Three proteomics datasets and one metabolomics dataset indicate missing values could be a mixture of abundance-dependent and abundance-independent missingness. We assess the performance of GMSimpute using simulated data (with a wide range of 80 missing patterns) and metabolomics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma studies. Using Pearson correlation and normalized root mean square errors between the true and imputed abundance, we compare its performance to K-nearest neighbors' type approaches, Random Forest, GSimp, a model-based method implemented in DanteR and minimum values. The results indicate GMSimpute provides higher accuracy in imputation and exhibits stable performance across different missing patterns. In addition, GMSimpute is able to identify the features in downstream differential expression analysis with high accuracy when applied to the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.

However, due to the dynamic nature of the discovery mass spectrometry, the generated data contain a substantial fraction of missing values. This poses great challenges for data analyses, as many tools, especially those for high dimensional data, cannot deal with missing values directly. To address this problem, the NCI-CPTAC Proteogenomics DREAM Challenge was carried out to develop effective imputation algorithms for labeled LC-MS/MS proteomics data through crowd learning. The final resulting algorithm, DreamAI, is based on an ensemble of six different imputation methods. The imputation accuracy of DreamAI, as measured by Pearson correlation, is about 15\%-50\% greater than existing tools among less abundant proteins, which are more vulnerable to be missed in proteomics data sets. This new tool notably enhances data analysis capabilities in proteomics research.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression profile analyses have been used in numerous studies covering a broad range of areas in biology. When unreliable measurements are excluded, missing values are introduced in gene expression profiles. Although existing multivariate analysis methods have difficulty with the treatment of missing values, this problem has received little attention. There are many options for dealing with missing values, each of which reaches drastically different results. Ignoring missing values is the simplest method and is frequently applied. This approach, however, has its flaws. In this article, we propose an estimation method for missing values, which is based on Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA). Although the methodology that a probabilistic model and latent variables are estimated simultaneously within the framework of Bayes inference is not new in principle, actual BPCA implementation that makes it possible to estimate arbitrary missing variables is new in terms of statistical methodology.Results: When applied to DNA microarray data from various experimental conditions, the BPCA method exhibited markedly better estimation ability than other recently proposed methods, such as singular value decomposition and K-nearest neighbors. While the estimation performance of existing methods depends on model parameters whose determination is difficult, our BPCA method is free from this difficulty. Accordingly, the BPCA method provides accurate and convenient estimation for missing values.Availability: The software is available at http://hawaii.aist-nara.ac.jp/{\textasciitilde}shige-o/tools/},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children and young adults. TBI is an example of a medical condition where there are still major lacks in diagnostics and outcome prediction. Here we apply comprehensive metabolic profiling of serum samples from TBI patients and controls in two independent cohorts. The discovery study included 144 TBI patients, with the samples taken at the time of hospitalization. The patients were diagnosed as severe (sTBI; n~=~22), moderate (moTBI; n~=~14) or mild TBI (mTBI; n~=~108) according to Glasgow Coma Scale. The control group (n~=~28) comprised of acute orthopedic non-brain injuries. The validation study included sTBI (n~=~23), moTBI (n~=~7), mTBI (n~=~37) patients and controls (n~=~27). We show that two medium-chain fatty acids (decanoic and octanoic acids) and sugar derivatives including 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid are strongly associated with severity of TBI, and most of them are also detected at high concentrations in brain microdialysates of TBI patients. Based on metabolite concentrations from TBI patients at the time of hospitalization, an algorithm was developed that accurately predicted the patient outcomes (AUC~=~0.84 in validation cohort). Addition of the metabolites to the established clinical model (CRASH), comprising clinical and computed tomography data, significantly improved prediction of patient outcomes. The identified `TBI metabotype' in serum, that may be indicative of disrupted blood-brain barrier, of protective physiological response and altered metabolism due to head trauma, offers a new avenue for the development of diagnostic and prognostic markers of broad spectrum of TBIs.,                         Image 1                                 ,                                        {$\bullet$}               The study reports that serum metabolites are sensitive to severity of TBI as well as predict the patient outcomes.                                         {$\bullet$}               The findings are indicative of disruption in blood brain barrier and of protective response and altered TBI metabolism.                                         {$\bullet$}               Metabolites significantly improved the prediction of patient outcomes when added to the established clinical model.                                 , Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an example of a medical condition where there are still major lacks in diagnostics, outcome prediction, and the therapy development. Since the blood-brain barrier prevents diffusion of most water-soluble molecules with molecular mass over 500~Da, here we hypothesized that circulating small molecules (metabolites) are a potential source of TBI markers. Based on serum metabolomic studies in two independent cohorts, we found that metabolites are sensitive to severity of TBI as well as predict the patient outcomes. The findings of this study may pave the way for new diagnostic tools for TBI.},

Missing values (MVs) are pervasive, yet the treatment of MVs can have a substantial impact on downstream statistical analyses. The MVs problem in metabolomics is quite challenging and can arise because the metabolite is not biologically present in the sample, or is present in the sample but at a concentration below the lower limit of detection (LOD), or is present in the sample but undetected due to technical issues related to sample pre-processing steps. The former is considered missing not at random (MNAR) while the latter is an example of missing at random (MAR). Typically, such MVs are substituted by a minimum value, which may lead to severely biased results in downstream analyses.                                         Results               We develop a Bayesian model, called BayesMetab, that systematically accounts for missing values based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that incorporates data augmentation by allowing MVs to be due to either truncation below the LOD or other technical reasons unrelated to its abundance. Based on a variety of performance metrics (power for detecting differential abundance, area under the curve, bias and MSE for parameter estimates), our simulation results indicate that BayesMetab outperformed other imputation algorithms when there is a mixture of missingness due to MAR and MNAR. Further, our approach was competitive with other methods tailored specifically to MNAR in situations where missing data were completely MNAR. Applying our approach to an analysis of metabolomics data from a mouse myocardial infarction revealed several statistically significant metabolites not previously identified that were of direct biological relevance to the study.                                         Conclusions               Our findings demonstrate that BayesMetab has improved performance in imputing the missing values and performing statistical inference compared to other current methods when missing values are due to a mixture of MNAR and MAR. Analysis of real metabolomics data strongly suggests this mixture is likely to occur in practice, and thus, it is important to consider an imputation model that accounts for a mixture of missing data types.},

However, incomplete biological information regarding the regulation of growth and metabolism in many microbial communities restricts progress in the site-specific mineralization process. In the postgenomic era, recent advances in MS have allowed enormous progress in proteomics and elucidated many complex biological interactions. These research forefronts are now expanding toward the analysis of low-molecular-weight primary and secondary metabolites analysis, i.e., metabolomics. The advent of 2-DE in conjunction with MS offers a promising approach to address the molecular mechanisms of bioremediation. The two fields of proteomics and metabolomics have thus far worked separately to identify proteins and primary and secondary metabolites during bioremediation. A simultaneous study combining functional proteomics and metabolomics, i.e., proteometabolomics would create a system-wide approach to studying site-specific microorganisms during active mineralization processes.

  abstract = {Motivation: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.Results: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.Availability: The {$\mathbb{R}$} package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.Contact:stekhoven@stat.math.ethz.ch; buhlmann@stat.math.ethz.ch},

Two strategies are available to address missing values: (i) eliminate or impute the missing values and apply statistical methods that require complete data and (ii) use statistical methods that specifically account for missing values without imputation (imputation-free methods). This study reviews the effect of sample size and percentage of missing values on statistical inference for multiple methods under these two strategies. With increasing missingness, the ability of imputation and imputation-free methods to identify differentially and non-differentially regulated compounds in a two-group comparison study declined. Random forest and k-nearest neighbor imputation combined with a Wilcoxon test performed well in statistical testing for up to 50\% missingness with little bias in estimating the effect size. Quantile regression imputation accompanied with a Wilcoxon test also had good statistical testing outcomes but substantially distorted the difference in means between groups. None of the imputation-free methods performed consistently better for statistical testing than imputation methods.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data.Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1--20\% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.Availability: The software is available at http://smi-web.stanford.edu/projects/helix/pubs/impute/Contact: russ.altman@stanford.edu*To whom correspondence should be addressed.},

Improper data processing procedures for missing values will cause adverse impacts on subsequent statistical analyses. However, few imputation methods have been developed and applied to the situation of MNAR in the field of metabolomics. Thus, a practical left-censored missing value imputation method is urgently needed. We developed an iterative Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach (GSimp). We compared GSimp with other three imputation methods on two real-world targeted metabolomics datasets and one simulation dataset using our imputation evaluation pipeline. The results show that GSimp outperforms other imputation methods in terms of imputation accuracy, observation distribution, univariate and multivariate analyses, and statistical sensitivity. Additionally, a parallel version of GSimp was developed for dealing with large scale metabolomics datasets.

Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random (MNAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing completely at random (MCAR). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC)) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student's               t               -test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that RF performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for left-censored MNAR.

  abstract = {The analysis of high-throughput metabolomics mass spectrometry data across multiple biological sample types (biospecimens) poses challenges due to missing data. During differential abundance analysis, dropping samples with missing values can lead to severe loss of data as well as biased results in group comparisons and effect size estimates. However, the imputation of missing data (the process of replacing missing data with estimated values such as a mean) may compromise the inherent intra-subject correlation of a metabolite across multiple biospecimens from the same subject, which in turn may compromise the efficacy of the statistical analysis of differential metabolites in biomarker discovery. We investigated imputation strategies when considering multiple biospecimens from the same subject. We compared a novel, but simple, approach that consists of combining the two biospecimen data matrices (rows and columns of subjects and metabolites) and imputes the two biospecimen data matrices together to an approach that imputes each biospecimen data matrix separately. We then compared the bias in the estimation of the intra-subject multi-specimen correlation and its effects on the validity of statistical significance tests between two approaches. The combined approach to multi-biospecimen studies has not been evaluated previously even though it is intuitive and easy to implement. We examine these two approaches for five imputation methods: random forest, k nearest neighbor, expectation-maximization with bootstrap, quantile regression, and half the minimum observed value. Combining the biospecimen data matrices for imputation did not greatly increase efficacy in conserving the correlation structure or improving accuracy in the statistical conclusions for most of the methods examined. Random forest tended to outperform the other methods in all performance metrics, except specificity.},

Although a number of methodologies have been applied to handle NAs, NA imputation remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)-based method for NA imputation in MS-based metabolomics data, which makes use of both global and local information of the data. The proposed method was compared with three commonly used methods: k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF), and outlier-robust (ORI) missing values imputation. These methods were evaluated from the perspectives of accuracy of imputation, retrieval of data structures, and rank of imputation superiority. The experimental results showed that the NMF-based method is well-adapted to various cases of data missingness and the presence of outliers in MS-based metabolic profiles. It outperformed kNN and ORI and showed results comparable with the RF method. Furthermore, the NMF method is more robust and less susceptible to outliers as compared with the RF method. The proposed NMF-based scheme may serve as an alternative NA imputation method which may facilitate biological interpretations of metabolomics data.},

Here we discuss the impact and advantages of the progress made in profiling large cohorts and dynamic systems with high temporal resolution and automated sampling. In both areas, high-throughput metabolomics is gaining traction because it can generate hypotheses on molecular mechanisms and metabolic regulation.

  abstract = {Missing data are ubiquitous in the era of big data and, if inadequately handled, are known to lead to biased findings and have deleterious impact on data-driven decision makings. To mitigate its impact, many missing value imputation methods have been developed. However, the fairness of these imputation methods across sensitive groups has not been studied. In this paper, we conduct the first known research on fairness of missing data imputation. By studying the performance of imputation methods in three commonly used datasets, we demonstrate that unfairness of missing value imputation widely exists and may be associated with multiple factors. Our results suggest that, in practice, a careful investigation of related factors can provide valuable insights on mitigating unfairness associated with missing data imputation.},
